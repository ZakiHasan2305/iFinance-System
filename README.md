# iFinance-System

A sophisticated Personal Finance Management System.

Leveraging JavaFX for a seamless user interface, the system incorporates secure user
authentication with admin functionalities and utilizes an SQL database
for efficient data storage. I implemented key features such as user management, customizable group structures, and a dynamic Chart of Accounts. Overall, my work on iFinance reflects my proficiency in JavaFX, SQL, and my ability to contribute to the development of comprehensive financial software solutions.
